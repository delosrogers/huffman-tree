# Huffman Tree
A basic implementation of Huffman coding.


In order to run first install rust and cargo https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html

Next run build and run using `cargo run` and it will read the contents of `file.txt` and write the tree to std out.

You can also build a release binary using `cargo build --release`
